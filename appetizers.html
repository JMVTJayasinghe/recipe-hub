            <h2>Deviled Eggs</h2>
            <b>Ingredients - Eggs,Mayonnaise, Dijon mustard and apple cider vinegar, Salt and pepper</b>
            <p>Place the eggs in a medium pot and cover them with an inch of cold water.
Bring the water to a rolling boil. Then, immediately cover the pot and turn off the heat.
Let the eggs sit in the hot water for 10 to 12 minutes.
Transfer them to a bowl of ice water. Chill in the ice bath for 14 minutes before peeling under cool running water.</p>
            <h2>Stuffed Mushrooms</h2>
           <b>Ingredients - Mushrooms, Pine nuts and panko bread crumbs, Parsley </b>
           <p>After you clean and stem the mushrooms, season them. Place the cleaned mushroom caps, cavity side up, on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Drizzle them with olive oil, and season them generously with salt and pepper.
            Next, make the filling. Stir together the grated cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, parsley, panko bread crumbs, garlic, pine nuts, salt, and a few grinds of black pepper.
            Then, stuff the mushrooms. Spoon the filling into the mushroom cavities, carefully piling it as high as you can. As you spoon the stuffing onto the mushrooms, some of it may tumble off. Thatâ€™s ok! Do your best to get as much into each mushroom as you can.
            And finally, bake! Generously drizzle the stuffed mushrooms with more oil and bake for 20 minutes or so, until the mushrooms are tender and the filling is golden brown. Allow them to cool slightly. Then, season to taste, and eat!
